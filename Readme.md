Abstract
In the current era of digitalization, one of the major means of transaction 'cheque' is still done via physical paper. This system is inefficient and expensive as it requires printing cheques and staffs to process cheques manually. We propose a digital system for the purpose that cheque fulfills: delayed guarantee of payment. Our system is much more reliable than physical cheque because the drawer can only issue cheque of amount that will be determined based on his financial history. Failure to reach the amount specified by the cheque will result in deduction of his credit score. It will also be more efficient and economical as it does not require any phsical instruments and additional staffs. Once the time is reached the amount will automatically be deducted from the drawer and transfereed to the drawee resulting in a much more covinient system as opposed to the physical cheques in which one has tl physically visit the bank.
